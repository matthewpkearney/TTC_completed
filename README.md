# TTC_completed
A racket document which runs an inductive algorithm on a 2^n x 2^n courtyard of tiles to place trominos strategically such that there is one filler tile untouched. The inductive proof for why this works for all scenarios on input value n is available at this link: https://math.hmc.edu/funfacts/inductive-tiling/
